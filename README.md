# PentaDevs
Six software developers in C++/C# Study Group.  
- Hanju
- Yongho
- Taehwan
- Byongmin
- Jongsang
- Hyunjung

## Preparation
Hanju received many applications. He has to test every candidate and choose 5 people.  
Group creation: 2022-02-22  
Members are Hanju Moon, Byongmin Park, Jongsang Tack, Taehwan Kim, Yongho Kang and Hyunjung Jang (She joined newly 2022-09-20). We shared motivation, objectives, resolution of ourselves. A few rules are created.  Study method, meeting frequency and time also have been discussed.  

### Rules and guidelines
- Hanju conducts the study group. Everyone should share own idea, speak frankly, not to be shy.
- The common objective is to improve development efficiency.
- All members meet every Monday 22:30-24:00. Only 22:30 works for everyone, it looks too late, but we couldn't find other time. :)
- Every member must NOT interrupt day working time due to study group activity.
- Any materials, documents, links, videos should be shared actively.
- Everyone won't use company's asset for the study group activity.
- Everyone follows lecture style. It is round-robin.
- There is no official text-book. Instead, there are many reference books, seminars, papers, articles, and of course, standards.
- Feature, paper, technical topic can be subject of study.
- Activity is opened to public.
