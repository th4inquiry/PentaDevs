# Idea

Biweekly.  
1st week: Use what we learn through the 1st step.  
2nd week: _Learn C++17/20 or C++20 or C++23._

## Subject proposal for the 2nd step
1. Jongsang
   1. Focus on C++20 first. Let's take a look at C++17 or other when we need.
   1. Big four
1. Taehwan
   1. Learn C++17/20 like first step. Find out topics from cppreference.
   1. Refactoring and revise product code using modern C++ and review it each other.
   1. Get a certificate
1. Byongmin
   1. Learn C++17/20 as same as the first step.
   1. Check C++17/20 features first (using cppreference.com)
1. Yongho
   1. Learn C++17/20 features like the first step, sequantially.
1. Hanju
   1. Revise product code using modern C++. Every member shows code-diff in 10~20 mins. Biweekly (1st week)
   1. Focus on C++23 first. Learn latest standard. Biweekly (2nd week)
